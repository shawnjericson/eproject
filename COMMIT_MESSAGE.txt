feat: Improve search and filter system to work independently

## Problem
The search and filter system was not working correctly:
- Search only worked when filters were selected
- All filters had to be selected for filtering to work
- Not flexible or intuitive for users

## Solution
Changed from `has()` + `!== ''` to `filled()` method:
- `filled()` checks both key exists AND value is not empty
- Properly handles null, empty string, 0, and false values
- Only applies filter when value is actually provided

## Changes

### Backend Controllers (10 files)
- app/Http/Controllers/Api/MonumentController.php
- app/Http/Controllers/Admin/MonumentController.php
- app/Http/Controllers/Api/PostController.php
- app/Http/Controllers/Admin/PostController.php
- app/Http/Controllers/Api/UserController.php
- app/Http/Controllers/Admin/UserController.php
- app/Http/Controllers/Api/FeedbackController.php
- app/Http/Controllers/Admin/FeedbackController.php
- app/Http/Controllers/Api/GalleryController.php
- app/Http/Controllers/Admin/GalleryController.php

### Frontend Views (1 file)
- resources/views/admin/gallery/index.blade.php (added search field)

### Documentation (5 files)
- README_SEARCH_FILTER.md (quick start guide)
- SEARCH_FILTER_SUMMARY.md (summary)
- SEARCH_FILTER_GUIDE.md (detailed guide)
- TEST_SEARCH_FILTER.md (test cases)
- test_search_filter.sh (test script)
- public/test-search-filter.html (visual test interface)

## Features

### Now Working ✅
- Search works independently without filters
- Each filter works independently
- Can combine search + 1 or multiple filters
- Unselected filters are ignored
- Intuitive like popular systems (Google, Amazon)

### Modules Updated
1. **Monuments** - Search + Filter by Status + Zone
2. **Posts** - Search + Filter by Status
3. **Users** - Search + Filter by Role + Status
4. **Feedbacks** - Search + Filter by Monument + Days
5. **Gallery** - Search + Filter by Monument

## Testing

### Quick Test
Open: http://localhost:8000/test-search-filter.html

### Manual Test
1. Go to /admin/monuments
2. Try search "temple" (without selecting filters) ✅
3. Try filter Zone = "East" (without search) ✅
4. Try search + filter combination ✅

### API Test
```bash
# Only search
curl "http://localhost:8000/api/monuments?search=temple"

# Only filter
curl "http://localhost:8000/api/monuments?zone=East"

# Combined
curl "http://localhost:8000/api/monuments?search=temple&zone=East"
```

## Breaking Changes
None - backward compatible

## Migration Required
None

## Performance Impact
Positive - more efficient queries when filters are not used
