# ✅ Ownership Permission System - Fixed!

## 🔒 Security Issue

### Problem (CRITICAL)
**Moderators could edit/delete content created by other users!**

This was a **serious security vulnerability** where:
- ❌ Moderator A could edit/delete posts created by Moderator B
- ❌ Moderator could edit/delete posts created by Admin
- ❌ Moderator could edit/delete monuments created by other users
- ❌ Moderator could edit/delete gallery images of monuments they don't own

### Impact
- **Data Integrity**: Users could modify/delete others' work
- **Accountability**: No clear ownership of content
- **Trust**: Moderators could abuse their privileges

---

## ✅ Solution Implemented

### 1. Created CheckOwnershipMiddleware

**Purpose**: Ensure moderators can only edit/delete their own content

**Logic**:
```php
// Admin can do anything
if ($user->role === 'admin') {
    return $next($request);
}

// Moderators can only edit/delete their own content
if ($user->role === 'moderator') {
    if ($content->created_by !== $user->id) {
        abort(403, 'You can only edit or delete content that you created.');
    }
}
```

**Special handling for Gallery**:
- Gallery doesn't have `created_by` field
- Check ownership through the monument: `$gallery->monument->created_by`

### 2. Applied Middleware to Routes

**Web Routes (routes/web.php)**:
```php
// Posts
Route::get('posts/{post}/edit')->middleware('check.ownership');
Route::put('posts/{post}')->middleware('check.ownership');
Route::delete('posts/{post}')->middleware(['check.ownership', 'prevent.approved.deletion']);

// Monuments
Route::get('monuments/{monument}/edit')->middleware('check.ownership');
Route::put('monuments/{monument}')->middleware('check.ownership');
Route::delete('monuments/{monument}')->middleware(['check.ownership', 'prevent.approved.deletion']);

// Gallery
Route::get('gallery/{gallery}/edit')->middleware('check.ownership');
Route::put('gallery/{gallery}')->middleware('check.ownership');
Route::delete('gallery/{gallery}')->middleware('check.ownership');
```

**API Routes (routes/api.php)**: Same middleware applied

### 3. Updated Views to Hide Buttons

**Posts Index (resources/views/admin/posts/index.blade.php)**:
```php
@php
    $canEdit = auth()->user()?->isAdmin() || $post->created_by === auth()->id();
    $canDelete = auth()->user()?->isAdmin() || ($post->created_by === auth()->id() && $post->status !== 'approved');
@endphp

@if($canEdit)
    <a href="{{ route('admin.posts.edit', $post) }}">Edit</a>
@endif

@if($canDelete)
    <button>Delete</button>
@endif
```

**Monuments Index**: Same logic applied

**Gallery Index**: Check through monument ownership

## 🧪 Testing

### Test Data Created
```
Users:
  - Admin: Admin User (ID: 1)
  - Moderator 1: Moderator User (ID: 2)
  - Moderator 2: Joyce My Nguyễn (ID: 8)

Posts:
  - Post #18: 'Test Post by Mod 1' by Moderator 1
  - Post #19: 'Test Post by Mod 2' by Moderator 2

Monuments:
  - Monument #58: 'Test Monument by Mod 1' by Moderator 1
  - Monument #59: 'Test Monument by Mod 2' by Moderator 2
```

### Test Scenarios

#### ✅ Scenario 1: Moderator edits their own post
```
User: Moderator 1 (ID: 2)
Post: #18 (created_by: 2)
Action: Edit
Result: ✅ Allowed
```

#### ❌ Scenario 2: Moderator edits another's post
```
User: Moderator 1 (ID: 2)
Post: #19 (created_by: 8)
Action: Edit
Result: ❌ Forbidden (403)
Error: "You can only edit or delete content that you created."
```

#### ✅ Scenario 3: Admin edits any post
```
User: Admin (ID: 1)
Post: #18 (created_by: 2)
Action: Edit
Result: ✅ Allowed
```

#### ❌ Scenario 4: Moderator deletes approved post (their own)
```
User: Moderator 1 (ID: 2)
Post: #18 (created_by: 2, status: approved)
Action: Delete
Result: ❌ Forbidden (403)
Error: "Cannot delete approved content."
```

### How to Test Manually

**1. Login as Moderator 1**
```
Email: moderator@example.com
Password: password

Try:
- /admin/posts/18/edit ✅ Should work
- /admin/posts/19/edit ❌ Should get 403
```

**2. Login as Moderator 2**
```
Email: joyce@example.com
Password: password

Try:
- /admin/posts/19/edit ✅ Should work
- /admin/posts/18/edit ❌ Should get 403
```

**3. Login as Admin**
```
Email: admin@example.com
Password: password

Try:
- /admin/posts/18/edit ✅ Should work
- /admin/posts/19/edit ✅ Should work
```

### Run Test Script
```bash
php test_ownership.php
```

This will:
- Create test users (if needed)
- Create test posts and monuments
- Show test scenarios
- Provide URLs to test manually

## 📝 Summary

### What Was Fixed
- ❌ **Before**: Moderators could edit/delete anyone's content
- ✅ **After**: Moderators can only edit/delete their own content

### How It Was Fixed
1. Created `CheckOwnershipMiddleware` to check ownership
2. Applied middleware to all edit/update/delete routes
3. Updated views to hide buttons based on ownership
4. Created test script to verify functionality

### What's Protected Now
- ✅ Posts: Edit, Update, Delete
- ✅ Monuments: Edit, Update, Delete
- ✅ Gallery: Edit, Update, Delete (via monument ownership)

### Who Can Do What
- **Admin**: Can edit/delete anything ✅
- **Moderator**: Can only edit/delete their own content ✅
- **Moderator**: Cannot delete approved content (even their own) ✅

## 🚀 Next Steps (Optional)

1. **Add audit log**: Track who edited/deleted what and when
2. **Add transfer ownership**: Allow admin to transfer content ownership
3. **Add bulk operations**: Allow admin to bulk approve/delete
4. **Add notifications**: Notify users when their content is approved/rejected
5. **Add content history**: Track changes to content over time
